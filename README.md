# Survery-about-IT-Professionals
This project is the summarization of the survey that was conducted by Kaggle to see the most common tool used by IT professionals.
The link to the data set: https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2020
The steps of this project:
1) Collect the data from the database and convert it to a usable form using trim,clean,substitute,etc.(I mainly relied on power query for the former)
2) Organize the data using pivot table wizard to convert it to long form so I can filter out the information that I needed 
3) Create charts using the new data and make each new chart as a pdf
The survey questions will be among the files
If you want to see the number of professionals filtered by country check out my tablaeu map

Note: I wanted to make these as interactive dashboards but I wanted to practice my excel not tablaeu for this project.
Hopefully I am going to upload another project solely dedicated to tablaeu and SQL in the near future; stay tuned.

Thank You for your time
